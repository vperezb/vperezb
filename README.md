I like to keep thinks as Simple as possible "✨aSap✨".

I usually get involved in more projects than time I have.

I'm currently working on [google-api-support](https://github.com/vperezb/google-api-support). Any help will be very welcome!

I like to program in Python to do watever I've done more than 2 times manually.

When I don't know how to doit I usually end in StackOverflow. If there's no anser I keep searching and I post the answer when I found it. Here's my [StackOverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6109224/vperezb).

To publish more complex solutions, I started to write in my [Github](https://github.com/vperezb) page but also on [Medium](https://medium.com/@victor.perez.berruezo) (I need to choose which one I want to keep and migrate everything else).

I also contribute in the Catalan translation of [Proton](https://proton.me/) services.

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vperezb-) to check full professional-"work" background

And more privately at vperezb+contact@proton.me.
