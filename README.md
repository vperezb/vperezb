I like to keep things as simple as possible "asap".

I usually get involved in more projects than time I have.

I'm currently working on [google-api-support](https://github.com/vperezb/google-api-support). Any help will be very welcome!

I like to program in Python to do whatever I've done more than 2 times manually.

When I don't know how to do it, I usually end up on StackOverflow. If there's no answer, I keep searching and post the answer when I find it. Here's my [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6109224/vperezb) profile.

To publish more complex solutions, I started to write in my [Github]([https://vperezb.github.io/]) page but also on [Medium](https://medium.com/@victor.perez.berruezo) (I need to choose which one I want to keep and migrate everything else).
